Some tinkering with obd-py lib while fixing my old car.

Using a Wifi OBD-2 adapter.

To test if the Wifi adapter works ping with this command: ```ping <YOUR_MAC_ADDRESS>``` and see if you recieve and data/requests from it.

Example use: ``` python3 check_pid.py``` run this in the console.

Will further work on this a bit more.
